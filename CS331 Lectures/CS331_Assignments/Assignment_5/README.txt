dependencies on UBUNTU system:
sudo apt-get install swi-prolog-nox
sudo apt-get install gprolog

To run use:
swipl
[ans].

or

gprolog
[ans].

1. squareroot(X, Result, Acc): I have used newton's method to compute the square root of the given input X as a variable.
It initializes the Result to X/2 and then runs newton's method. This simply gives no for negative numbers.
2. subList(X, Y): I have changed its name from sublist(X, Y) because a preinstalled predicate was already there
in gprolog.
